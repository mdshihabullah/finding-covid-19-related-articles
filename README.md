# Finding Covid-19 related articles from scientific journal using Naive Bayes classifier

In this project, I have tried to find out whether the articles available in one of the
recommended dataset comprising scientific publications are COVID-19 related or not
using Naive Bayes classifier.

Various utility steps, function and core methods undertaken to achieve the tasks are
mentioned and coded both with comments and required documentation in the submitted Jupyter notebook file.
